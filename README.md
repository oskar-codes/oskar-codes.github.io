# About me
I’m a 15 years old web and game developer based in Zurich, Switzerland. I’m the main programmer at [@Artridge](https://twitter.com/ArtridgeGames), where I work on the projects available [here](https://artridge.itch.io).
Below are linked my own creations, that I develop in my free time.

# My projects
