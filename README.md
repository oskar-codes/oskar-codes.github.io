# About me
I’m a 15 years old web and game developer based in Zurich, Switzerland. I’m the main programmer at [@Artridge](https://twitter.com/ArtridgeGames), where I work on the projects available [here](https://artridge.itch.io).
Below are linked my own creations, that I develop in my free time.

# My projects
## Desktop Apps
### Notes app
[Notes app](https://www.mediafire.com/file/4bxkfdjo39megu0/Notes-win32-x64.zip/file) is a simple note manager made using ElectronJS. It lets you easily create and edit notes, with an advanced rich text editor.

## Web apps
### Tile Swap
[Tile Swap](/tile-swap) is a little puzzle game with random generation, which means there's an infinite amount of puzzles for you to solve!

### Web chat
[Web chat](/web-chat) is a prototype showing how you can use the realtime database in Google's Firebase service to host data for a messaging web app. This chat features a global room where anyone can chat, and a private room creation feature. Just click the room name on the top left of your screen and start chatting privately!

### Webline
[Webline](/webline) is a web based terminal with lots of useful functions, like image to base64 conversion, client data fetching and much more!

## Chrome extensions
I've also made two Chrome extensions that you might find useful. To install them, unzip the downloaded file, and then browse to chrome://extensions. Activate developer mode, and then click "load unpacked". You can then browse to the unziped folder and select it in order to load the extension.
### Web Image Converter
[Web Image Converter](https://github.com/oskar-codes/oskar-codes.github.io/raw/master/extensions/web-image-converter.zip) let's you convert images to PNG or JPG simply by right clicking images you find online, and pressing convert. It's as easy as that!

### Password Input Displayer
[Password Input Displayer](https://github.com/oskar-codes/oskar-codes.github.io/raw/master/extensions/PasswordInputDisplayer.zip) let's you easily check if the password you typed in a password field is correct. Just right-click the input field, and click "Show Password" to display it.

### Deep Fryer
[Deep Fryer](https://github.com/oskar-codes/oskar-codes.github.io/raw/master/extensions/deep-fryer.zip) let's you toggle a DeepFry filter on any web page, because why not!
